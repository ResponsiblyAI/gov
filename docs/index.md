# Operationalizing Responsible AI <br> Congressional Workshop

Time: __August 7-8, 2023__  
Place: __Russell 385__ 

## Overview

As AI becomes prevalent in many aspects of our lives, it's crucial to ensure that AI driven systems align with our societal values. A key factor in achieving this is how AI systems will be governed and regulated. Effective AI governance and regulation is challenging: open-ended legal and ethical concepts such as "fairness" or "privacy" must be transposed to concrete design specifications. This task requires “Responsible AI literacy” - an understanding of how AI systems are developed and deployed, and how design choices throughout the system life cycle affect legal, ethical and normative outcomes.

During the workshop, participants will enhance their Responsible AI literacy and develop their skills to conduct an effective and critical dialogue with relevant experts.

The workshop consists of three interactive, hands-on sessions where participants engage in teamwork, designing and analyzing AI systems and discussing real-world scenarios to develop a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between AI design choices and ethical and legal implications.

This training methodology, further described [here](https://go.responsibly.ai/paper/open), was successfully implemented in multiple [settings](https://teach.responsibly.ai): academia:material-information-outline:{ title="Cornell Tech, Boston University, Princeton University, Georgetown University, Warwick University, Bocconi University, Technion, Tel Aviv University, University of Haifa. Next year also at University of California, Berkeley." }, industry:material-information-outline:{ title="At the NYC-based Runway accelerator to tech entrepreneurs." } and the government:material-information-outline:{ title="At OECD and the Israeli Government Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology, leading the National AI Initiative." }.

Participants are strongly encouraged to attend all three sessions. This is a hands-on workshop, so please remember to bring your laptop. Technical background in AI is not necessary for this workshop, it is designed specifically for policymakers.

## Sessions

### 1 Balancing trade-offs in the design of AI systems
To operationalize Responsible AI, one needs to translate technical specifications and human values, as well as to trade off between design alternatives. Every design choice carries normative implications and vice versa. 

In this session, the participants will engage in core aspects of Responsible AI through a case study pertaining to the use of AI in social services. 

The general lessons learned about the nature of trade-offs from this government case study apply to any AI system design. 

### 2 Deploying AI applications with foundation models & generative AI
The advent of recent technologies like ChatGPT has made the development of AI systems more accessible, enabling developers with some software engineering skills to create AI-based applications even with no technical expertise in AI. Ensuring these systems perform well, exhibit robustness and adhere to human values, however, requires more than software engineering skills.

In this session, the participants will have a crash course in prompt engineering, have the opportunity to build AI systems using foundation models and generative AI and delve into the challenges associated with evaluating and testing their performance with respect to Responsible AI.

### 3 Building content moderation systems for online platforms
Content moderation systems are powerful and sophisticated tools that have a crucial, daily impact on shaping speech in our society. Different design choices for content moderation systems are not simply technical: they imply significant normative meanings and invoke issues pertaining to various Responsible AI principles such as free speech, fairness, privacy, transparency, safety and human autonomy. Integrating these principles into a coherent functioning system is a daunting task.

In this “mini-hackathon” session, the participants will experiment with operationalizing these normative values by designing a content moderation system, and receive feedback on their work.
